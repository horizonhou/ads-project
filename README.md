# ads_pricing_competition

# INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this project was to participate in a class pricing competition based on the previous knowledge of demand estimation, revenue maximization, and pricing learned from the class. The project consists of two parts. Part one requires our team to come up with a pricing strategy based on the user valuation of an arbitrary product, opponent price, and history of sale. Part two requires our team to train a machine learning model and complete the tasks of demand estimation based on three user covariants, and revenue maximization to output the optimal price. Then based on this optimal price, we combine our strategy from part one to compete for customers. Each game will consist of two teams bidding prices for one customer without capacity constraints, the team with lower price under the valuation will win that round and gain revenue. Overall, the team with the most revenue across games will win the competition. As a result, we need to anticipate the moves of the opponent, and handle different situations with our algorithm. 

Specific techniques and strategies will be discussed extensively in the report below.
